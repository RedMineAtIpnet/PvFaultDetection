# Introduction:
The multiplication of photovoltaic panels number poses a problem for the maintenance teams. Indeed, for the fields which are in distant zones or little inhabited it is difficult to move for the control and the maintenance.
So, our IoT application is the proposed solution, it simplifies and makes more efficient maintenance operations and moving to the fields to verify their state. In fact, we will detect and identify the failure to avoid the movement of teams in the event of irreparable breakdowns.

# Description:
this project contains two parts:
- the first part is the collection and sending of data by Arduino boards
- the second is the processing of this data to detect and identify the failure
